# Stack Overflow – Analytics Engineering Case

## 📌 Project overview
This project was developed as part of an Analytics Engineering use case, using the public Stack Overflow dataset available in BigQuery.  
The main objective is to **identify popular and trending topics (tags) with a high volume of unanswered questions**, with a special focus on **new users**, in order to surface potential gaps in community support.

The solution covers the full analytics workflow:
- data modeling in BigQuery using **dbt**
- dimensional modeling (star schema)
- performance optimization (partitioning & clustering)
- data quality tests
- a BI-ready table consumed by a dashboard

---

## 📊 Data source
- **Dataset**: `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow`
- **Main tables used**:
  - `posts_questions`
  - `posts_answers`
  - `users`

All transformations are performed in BigQuery via dbt.

---

## 🧱 Data model
The model follows a **star schema**, designed to support analytical queries efficiently.

### Dimensions
- **dim_date**  
  Calendar dimension derived from question creation dates.

- **dim_tag**  
  One row per Stack Overflow tag, enriched with:
  - `tag_category` (e.g. language, framework, database)
  - `tag_domain` (frontend, backend, data, devops, other)

- **dim_user**  
  User metadata used for segmentation (e.g. new users vs experienced users).

### Fact
- **fact_question_day_tag_tbl**  
  Grain: **one row per day, per tag**  
  This is the final, BI-ready table used by the dashboard.

Key characteristics:
- Partitioned by `date`
- Clustered by `tag_key`
- Limited to the last 5 years to balance history and performance

## 📐 Metrics & logic
The fact table includes, among others:

- Total number of questions
- Number of unanswered questions
- Percentage of unanswered questions
- Number of unique askers
- Metrics segmented for **new users** (accounts ≤ 30 days old)
- Average score, views, and asker reputation

This allows answering questions such as:
- Which tags are popular but underserved?
- Are new users more likely to receive no answers?
- Which domains or categories have higher unanswered rates?

### Staging
- Light transformations
- Renaming and basic type casting
- No business logic

### Marts
- Dimensional modeling
- Business logic and aggregations
- Final table optimized for BI consumption

## 🧪 Data quality tests
Basic dbt tests are implemented to ensure data reliability:
- Primary keys are `not_null` and `unique` in dimension tables
- Mandatory fields in the fact table are `not_null`

Tests can be run with:
```bash
dbt test

▶️ How to run the project

Requirements:

dbt Cloud or dbt Core

Access to BigQuery

Steps:

dbt run
dbt test


The final table will be created in BigQuery and can be directly connected to a BI tool.

📈 Dashboard

The final table fact_question_day_tag_tbl is consumed by a dashboard (Looker Studio), which includes:

Overview KPIs (questions, unanswered rate)

Top tags with the highest number of unanswered questions

Trend analysis over time

Segmentation by tag category, domain, and new users

⚖️ Assumptions & trade-offs

Tag categorization is rule-based; in a production setting, this could be replaced by ML-based clustering or NLP on question titles.

User segmentation is simplified to “new users ≤ 30 days”.

Data volume is limited to the last 5 years for performance reasons.

🚀 Possible next steps

Apply NLP techniques to question titles to identify emerging topics beyond tags

Build incremental models for large-scale production usage

Introduce freshness and volume-based alerts for unanswered questions

Add semantic layer / metrics definitions for BI self-service
